# Some notes
1. When there is no input (input is empty), user will be prompted again for input.
2. When multiple numbers have the same number of occurrences, mode isn't unique. Sample result shows "none". So my code follows.
3. "quit quit" doesn't terminate app. Only "quit" does.
4. Some typical unit tests are included. More similar ones (such as null parameter check) can be written for more code coverage.
